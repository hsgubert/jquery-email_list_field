Form-ready dependency-less tagging.

## Install

NPM:

    npm install taggle --save

Bower:

    bower install taggle --save


## How it works

Taggle allows you to create tag fields within your forms, to allow for easy and optionally restricted, input from your users.

Each tag contains an hidden input with a configurable name of `taggles[]` by default so when taggle is inserted in a form, your server can easily read each item and continue accordingly. Taggle is highly customizable with your own css, or you can optionally use the included assets to start your own project.

Taggle also contains a simple API for you to easily hook in to your favorite autocomplete libraries.

- taggle-ie9.js
- taggle.js

### IE9 Support
- taggle-ie9.js
