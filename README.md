JQuery EmailListField.js
=========

Creates editable form field for email lists using jquery and jquery-ui.

## Install

Bower:

    bower install jquery-email_list_field --save


## How it works

EmailListField allows you to create a field in your forms that accept an email list input:

Each email added contains a hidden input with a configurable name of `emails[]` by default so your server can easily read each email. Users can write their emails also in the "Name <email>" format.

EmailListField can optionally show auto-complete options, if you pass it a list of known emails:

EmailListField has configurable callbacks that allow you to add custom styles depending on the email added, or do any other related action when an emails is added or removed.

## Dependencies
The lib was developed using
* jquery v1.12
* jquery-ui v1.11

It might as well work with newer jquery and jquery-ui versions (I welcome anyone willing to test it).
